# DS Portfolio — Workspace

About This Repository
This repository is the foundation for my long-term Data Science interview portfolio. All major projects (ML, GenAI, Analytics, Dashboards, Automations) will be built, documented, and deployed from here.

The goal is to create:
- 3 main live, interview-ready projects
- Clean Streamlit/Gradio demos
- FastAPI or Python backends
- Full documentation
- Clear architecture and reproducibility
- An interactive GenAI-powered portfolio assistant

Note:
The exact project themes are still evolving — this repo is structured to support any DS/ML/LLM project we decide to build.

Skills Showcased
- Python
- Debugging
- System/solution architecture
- GenAI and prompt engineering
- Data visualization
- Exploratory data analysis
- Practical ML model building

Tech Stack (flexible)
- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- Streamlit or Gradio
- FastAPI
- GitHub and CI/CD
- Markdown documentation
